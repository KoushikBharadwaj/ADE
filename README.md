# Urban Parking Management System

This project is an innovative parking management system designed to improve parking efficiency in urban areas with limited land. The system uses laser lights and LDR sensors to detect the occupancy of parking slots, providing real-time updates on slot availability.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a semester assignment to address parking challenges in urban areas. The system aims to reduce congestion, save time for drivers, and maximize the utility of available parking spaces.

## Features

- Real-time parking availability
- Automatic detection of occupied and empty slots
- User-friendly display of slot status
- Simple and efficient circuit design

## Components

- Laser lights
- LDR sensors
- 2.2k resistors
- BC 547 transistors
- Display for output

## Operation

1. **Empty Slot Detection**: When a slot is empty, the laser light emitted from the base falls on the LDR sensor, turning on the slot light to indicate availability.
2. **Occupied Slot Detection**: When a car is parked in the slot, the laser light is blocked, causing the slot light to turn off, indicating the slot is occupied.

## Usage

1. Power on the system.
2. Observe the display for real-time updates on slot availability.
3. Park your vehicle and watch the system update the slot status automatically.
